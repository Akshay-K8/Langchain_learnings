# ðŸ“š LangChain Learning Project

A hands-on learning project focused on exploring and experimenting with [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/), a powerful framework for developing applications with language models.

---

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

- `langchain_agent.ipynb`:  
  Notebook demonstrating how to build and run LangChain agents for various tasks.

- `langchain_loader_Retriver.ipynb`:  
  Covers document loading and retrieval techniques using retrievers in LangChain.

- `langchain_model_prompts.ipynb`:  
  Showcases prompt engineering techniques and custom prompt templates for language models.

- `langchain_Output.ipynb`:  
  Outputs and results from running different LangChain workflows and experiments.

- `requirements.txt`:  
  Contains all Python dependencies needed to run the project.

- `learnings.md`:  
  Personal learning notes and takeaways while exploring LangChain.

- `roadmap.md`:  
  Planned topics, features, and future learning goals related to LangChain.

- `.env`:  
  Environment variable file (e.g., API keys). **Not tracked in Git for security.**

- `langcamp/`:  
  Virtual environment folder. **Excluded from version control.**

- `data/`:  
  Directory to store datasets or input files used in the notebooks.

## ðŸ“¦ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Akshay-K8/Langchain_learnings
   cd Langchain_learnings
   ```
2. **Create a Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
    python -m venv langcamp
    source langcamp/bin/activate  # On Windows: langcamp\Scripts\activate
    ```
## ðŸ§  What I Learned
- Building agents and chains with LangChain.

- Working with retrievers for semantic search.

- Creating effective prompts for LLMs.

- Structuring projects and tracking learnings effectively.
