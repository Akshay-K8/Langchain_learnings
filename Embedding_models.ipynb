Additionally, techniques such as aligning time series data to word embedding space and reprogramming time series patches with text prototypes have been introduced to further enhance time series forecasting with LLMs. These advancements showcase the potential of LLMs in improving prediction accuracy and interpretability in time series analysis.'"
